                    Hello, my name is Ho Quang Linh, this year 21 years old, born and
                    raised in Gia Lai land, currently studying in Ho Chi Minh city, I
                    am attending a university: "university of transport Ho Chi Minh
                    city", majoring in information technology. It's fast to be a third
                    year student and prepare to enter the fourth year of student life,
                    prepare a new luggage, enter a livelihood, bring money back to
                    your mother. I think that everyone will have to swim far away,
                    find themselves a suitable place to freely find their passion,
                    find themselves.

                    In an instant, from a toddler boy entering the "Sai Thanh" land
                    that day, now has passed quickly, until I realized that in time,
                    whatever comes will come, I will rarely sit on it. more school
                    seats, reaching out to find opportunities for themselves, because
                    a great motivation is family. After 21 years of studying, it's
                    time for me to do something for my small home, and that's also the
                    reason why I'm gradually improving myself, to have a good
                    internship and battle. The best way to predict the future is to

                          <p>
                            I am a person who is rated as gentle and kind, although I am not a
                            comedian, I know how to create laughter when talking and bring a
                            feeling of closeness and friendliness, but when working, I am
                            extremely serious. Be diligent, try to get the job done.

                              Teamwork and cooperation with other members are my strengths. In the
                              projects I've been on, most of the time I've taken on leadership
                              roles. As the team leader, I did a good job of inspiring and
                              motivating the other team members. Those projects, I always complete as early 
                              as possible 1-2 weeks before having to present in front of the class because I always anticipate 
                              the worst possible cases for the project.

                              I believe my strongest trait is my attention to detail. This trait has
                              helped me tremendously in this field of work.

                              I am always ready to take on pressure work when necessary. I don't
                              mind taking on a difficult client or doing a project that no one else
                              wants because those are the clients and projects that will give me a
                              lot of experience and experience. Because I always believe that, 
                              if you try your best, all your efforts will be rewarded

                              I believe my greatest strength is my ability to solve problems quickly
                              and efficiently. I can see multiple sides of an issue, which makes me
                              qualified to get my job done even under challenging conditions.

                              work well under pressure, and I've never been late for an appointment.
                              One particular example that popped into my head was when I was asked
                              to complete a project that a coworker forgot.

                              I'm usually pretty strict with myself and always think I can do
                              better. In the past I even tormented myself for this. Lately, however,
                              I've become more in control and self-satisfied with what I've done.

                              Thanks to my meticulousness and patience, I always successfully
                              complete all assigned tasks, even the smallest details. Before
                              starting a project, I always spend a lot of time learning the relevant
                              aspects as well as the most effective way to work.

                              I am always a person to experience and familiarize myself with newly
                              released software. My interest in IT allows me to explore in-depth
                              aspects of new software. When I have a problem, I have the ability to
                              find out and fix it quickly.

                          My father is like a friend to me. He loves me at all times. 
                          He teaches me all the values and morals I must live by. 
                          And he himself lives by all the values. He believes in practicing what he preaches. 
                          So I find my father very honest. And he never finds it difficult to be that way. 
                          My father is kind and generous. If anyone approaches him with a genuine need he helps them 
                          to whatever extent he can. And he never grudges any help he offers. 
                          My father is time conscious and punctual. He is strict with me because he wants me 
                          to be disciplined. Being disciplined is tough, but I know it is for my good. 
                          And so I always try my best to follow what my father tells me to do. 
                          Whenever I am in a difficulty my father helps me out with love and affection.
