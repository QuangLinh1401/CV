                    Hello, my name is Ho Quang Linh, this year 21 years old, born and
                    raised in Gia Lai land, currently studying in Ho Chi Minh city, I
                    am attending a university: "university of transport Ho Chi Minh
                    city", majoring in information technology. It's fast to be a third
                    year student and prepare to enter the fourth year of student life,
                    prepare a new luggage, enter a livelihood, bring money back to
                    your mother. I think that everyone will have to swim far away,
                    find themselves a suitable place to freely find their passion,
                    find themselves.

                    In an instant, from a toddler boy entering the "Sai Thanh" land
                    that day, now has passed quickly, until I realized that in time,
                    whatever comes will come, I will rarely sit on it. more school
                    seats, reaching out to find opportunities for themselves, because
                    a great motivation is family. After 21 years of studying, it's
                    time for me to do something for my small home, and that's also the
                    reason why I'm gradually improving myself, to have a good
                    internship and battle. The best way to predict the future is to

                          My father is like a friend to me. He loves me at all times. 
                          He teaches me all the values and morals I must live by. 
                          And he himself lives by all the values. He believes in practicing what he preaches. 
                          So I find my father very honest. And he never finds it difficult to be that way. 
                          My father is kind and generous. If anyone approaches him with a genuine need he helps them 
                          to whatever extent he can. And he never grudges any help he offers. 
                          My father is time conscious and punctual. He is strict with me because he wants me 
                          to be disciplined. Being disciplined is tough, but I know it is for my good. 
                          And so I always try my best to follow what my father tells me to do.
